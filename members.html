                The robotics program started two years ago as an after scool program. Now, the program is taking place as a class that is chosen by the students that want to take it. Last year was the first one and about a full class and many students liked it and convinced Mrs. Palmer to start an accelerated class for the returning members at school. 
                The robotics members that are participating this year for middle school are Gavin Walker, Nate Pagoaga, Hannah Parker, Abby Claire Crider, Malia Mahan, Nick Anderson, Ashton Swiney, and Sean Lackey. For fifth grade, the members are Parker George, Logan Lott, Blake Carlson, Ben Castellaw, Isabella Frank, and Lizzie Swingler.
