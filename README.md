TCA Robotics Club
We created our website for the TCA Robotics team. 
We chose the colors purple, black, and white because that is the color of TCA
Our client asked for us to explain some of the different competitions that they do and also to include a video of one of their competitions.
Our design decisions were to explain a couple of things about each topic and include a picture and sometimes a video to keep the people who view this page interested in the topic of TCA Robotics.
